### Voice-to-Text Web App

A responsive, browser-based speech-to-text application built with the Web Speech API and Web Audio API.
Supports continuous dictation, real-time transcription, and clipboard export, with visual feedback driven by live microphone input.

The app processes interim and final speech results separately, deduplicates repeated mobile recognition events, infers sentence boundaries from detected silence, and applies lightweight formatting before rendering a live transcript.
